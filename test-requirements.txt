# Pip requirements file for development.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Unit test direct dependencies (e.g. imports into testcases):

# pytest
# pytest 7.0.0 started using type hints
pytest>=7.0.0

# Install test direct dependencies:

# virtualenv
# tox 3.21.0 requires virtualenv!=20.0.[0-7],>=16.0.0 and requires py>=3.5
virtualenv>=20.1.0


# Indirect dependencies with special constraints:

# packaging (used by pytest)
packaging>=17.0

# pluggy (used by pytest, tox)
# Pluggy 0.12.0 has a bug causing pytest plugins to fail loading on py38
# pytest 4.3.1 depends on pluggy>=0.7
# tox 3.21.0 depends on pluggy>=0.12.0
pluggy>=0.13.1

# six (also used by virtualenv, tox, probably others)
# virtualenv 20.0 requires six>=1.12.0 on py>=3.8
