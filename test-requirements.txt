# Pip requirements file for development.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Unit test direct dependencies (e.g. imports into testcases):

# pytest
# pytest 5.0.0 has removed support for Python < 3.5
# pytest 4.3.1 solves an issue on Python 3 with minimum package levels
# pytest 6.0.0 causes pylint to report "not-callable" issues
pytest>=4.3.1,<5.0.0; python_version < '3.5'
pytest>=4.3.1,!=6.0; python_version >= '3.5' and python_version <= '3.6'
pytest>=4.4.0,!=6.0; python_version >= '3.7' and python_version <= '3.9'
pytest>=6.2.5; python_version >= '3.10'


# Install test direct dependencies:

# virtualenv
# Virtualenv 20.0.19 has an issue where it does not install pip on Python 3.4.
# Virtualenv 20.0.32 has an issue where it raises AttributeError on Python 3.4.
# tox 3.21.0 requires virtualenv!=20.0.[0-7],>=16.0.0 and requires py>=3.5
virtualenv>=16.1.0,!=20.0.19,!=20.0.32; python_version <= '3.4'
virtualenv>=20.1.0; python_version >= '3.5'


# Indirect dependencies with special constraints:

# packaging (used by pytest)
packaging>=17.0

# pluggy (used by pytest, tox)
# Pluggy 0.12.0 has a bug causing pytest plugins to fail loading on py38
# pytest 4.3.1 depends on pluggy>=0.7
# tox 3.21.0 depends on pluggy>=0.12.0
pluggy>=0.13.1

# pathlib2 (used by virtualenv on py<3.4 on non-Windows)
pathlib2<3,>=2.3.3; python_version < '3.4' and sys_platform != 'win32'


# Additional indirect dependencies are not specified in this file.
