# Pip requirements file for development.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance.
#
# Make sure that the minimum versions required in this file are consistent with
# the minimum versions specified in minimum-constraints.txt.


# Unit test direct dependencies (e.g. imports into testcases):

# pytest
# pytest 7.0.0 started using type hints
pytest>=7.0.0

# Install test direct dependencies:

# virtualenv
# virtualenv 20.18.0 dropped support for Python 3.6
# virtualenv 20.16.3 started requiring importlib-metadata>=4.8.3, but
#   flake8 4.0/5.0 requires importlib-metadata>=1.1.0,<4.3 on Python<=3.7
# virtualenv 20.2.1 started removing the prior pinning of importlib-metadata to <3
# tox 3.21.0 requires virtualenv!=20.0.[0-7],>=16.0.0 and requires Python >=3.5
virtualenv>=20.2.1,<20.16.3; python_version <= '3.7'
virtualenv>=20.23.0; python_version >= '3.8'


# Indirect dependencies with special constraints:

# packaging (used by pytest, safety)
packaging>=21.0; python_version == '3.6'
packaging>=22.0; python_version >= '3.7'

# pluggy (used by pytest, tox)
# Pluggy 0.12.0 has a bug causing pytest plugins to fail loading on py38
# pytest 4.3.1 depends on pluggy>=0.7
# tox 3.21.0 depends on pluggy>=0.12.0
pluggy>=0.13.1

# six (also used by virtualenv, tox, probably others)
# virtualenv 20.0 requires six>=1.12.0 on py>=3.8
# tox 3.17 requires six>=1.14.0
# six 1.16.0 fixes issue with 'six.moves' not available on Python 3.12
six>=1.14.0; python_version <= '3.11'
six>=1.16.0; python_version >= '3.12'


# Additional indirect dependencies are not specified in this file.
