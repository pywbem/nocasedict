# Indirect dependencies that must be handled early:

# importlib-metadata
# importlib-metadata
# importlib.metadata was integrated to standard Python in Python 3.8, so as a
#   package it is only needed in Python<=3.7.
# importlib-metadata 5.0 removed interfaces, and in the version integrated to
#   Python, that was done in Python 3.12 which integrated importlib-metadata 6.5.
# flake8 4.0/5.0 requires importlib-metadata>=1.1.0,<4.3 on Python<=3.7. flake8
#   pins importlib-metadata (at least) because flake8 <6.0 has not yet adjusted
#   to the removed interfaces in importlib-metadata 5.0 / Python 3.12.
# virtualenv 20.16.3 started requiring importlib-metadata>=4.8.3
# virtualenv 20.22.0 started requiring importlib-metadata>=6.4.1
importlib-metadata>=2.1.3,<5; python_version <= '3.7'


# Direct dependencies:

# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script):
# coveralls 3.3.0 pins coverage to <7.0, causing pip backtracking to happen. Pinning
#   it to <7.0 in this file saves the time for backtracking, but requires to
#   occasionally check for new versions of coveralls without pinning.
