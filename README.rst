Overview
--------

Class `NocaseDict`_ is a case-insensitive ordered dictionary that preserves
the original lexical case of its keys.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python
    >>> from nocasedict import NocaseDict

    >>> dict1 = NocaseDict({'Alpha': 1, 'Beta': 2})

    >>> dict1['ALPHA']  # Lookup by key is case-insensitive
    1

    >>> print(dict1)  # Keys are returned with the original lexical case
    NocaseDict({'Alpha': 1, 'Beta': 2})

The `NocaseDict`_ class supports the functionality of the built-in
`dict class of Python 3.8`_ on all Python versions it supports with
the following exceptions (and the case-insensitivity of course):

* The ``iter..()``, ``view..()`` and ``has_key()`` methods are only present
  on Python 2, consistent with the built-in ``dict`` class.

* The ``keys()``, ``values()`` and ``items()`` methods return a list on Python 2
  and a dictionary view on Python 3, consistent with the built-in ``dict``
  class.

.. _dict class of Python 3.8: https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#dict

Functionality can be added using mixin classes:

* `HashableMixin`_ mixin class: Adds case-insensitive hashability.

* `KeyableByMixin`_ mixin generator function: Adds ability to get the key from
  an attribute of the value object.

Why yet another case-insensitive dictionary: We found that all previously
existing case-insensitive dictionary packages on Pypi either had flaws, were
not well maintained, or did not support the Python versions we needed.
